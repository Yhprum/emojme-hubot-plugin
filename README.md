## Commands

* hubot emojme [00] help - print help message
  * ```
    Hey there! emojme is an project made to interface with the dark parts of slack's api: the emoji endpoints.

    In order to do anything with it here, you'll need to make sure that hubot knows about your list of emoji, which you can check on with `emojme status`.

    If there is no emoji cache or it's out of date, you can fix that with `@hubot emojme refresh`, that'll lead you by the hand to getting a user token and updating the list of emoji that I know about. There will be a 60 second time window to enter your token, so get a head start by checking out the docs [on the emojme repo](https://github.com/jackellenberger/emojme#finding-a-slack-token)

    Questions, comments, concerns? Ask em either on emojme, or on [this project](https://github.com/jackellenberger/emojme-hubot-plugin), whatever's relevant.
